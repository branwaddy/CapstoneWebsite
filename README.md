# Capstone Website

A website I made for an assignment in my Fullstack Web and Software Engineer course. It is informative about guitars and guitarists. I used Bootstrap to give it a sleek look. It has a form for **comments**, functions where you can **like** articles, and **save them for later**. The save for later function also adds these links to a page where you can find all the articles you saved.

## Contents:

1. Installation instructions
2. How to use
3. Screenshots
4. Credits

## Installation Instructions

Simply download the zip and extract all files to a folder

## How to Use

Launch 'index.html'. Click any headings at the top of the page to see various sections. Click the 'like' button to like an article, or click the 'add to favorites' button to add any article to favorites. Enter a comment at the bottom and click 'submit' to submit comment. Find all your favorited links on the 'My Favorites' page.
